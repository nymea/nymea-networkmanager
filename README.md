# nymea-networkmanager

This daemon allows to set up the wireless network using a bluetooth LE connection. The daemon will automatically start a bluetooth low energy server 
if the system is currently not connected to any network. Once the system is connected, the daemon will shutdown the bluetooth server. 

# Configuration

nymea-networkmanager will search for a config file in the following location:

    /etc/nymea/nymea-networkmanager.conf

If such a config file is found, it reads values from there. There is a example config in
this repository and it will be installed to /etc/nymea-networkmanager.conf with the dpkg package.

> Note: Command line parameters will have higher priority than entries in the configuration file.

* `Mode`: The mode specifies the default behavior of the daemon. Following modes are available:
    * `offline`: This mode starts the bluetooth server once the device is offline and not connected to any LAN network.
    * `once`: This mode starts the bluetooth server only if no network configuration exists. Once a network connection exists the server will never start again.
    * `button`: This mode enables the bluetooth server when the specified GPIO button has been pressed for more then 2 seconds. 
    * `always`: This mode enables the bluetooth server as long the application is running.
    * `start`: This mode starts the bluetooth server for 3 minutes on start and shuts down after a connection.
    * `dbus`: This mode enables the bluetooth server only using the DBus methods.
* `Timeout`: Value is in seconds. Minimum value is 10 seconds. This value specifies how long the server will advertise if no client will connect within this period, afterwards the servicer will be stopped. This value will only be used in modes `start`, `gpio` and `dbus`.
* `AdvertiseName`: The name advertise name of bluetooth server. The length is limited to 8 characters.
* `ForceFullName`: Enforce the full name to be used even if it is longer than 8 characters. **IMPORTANT**: This will displace the Service UUID in the discovery data which implies that client applications cannot discover the wifi setup service on this device any more.
* `PlatformName`: The name of the platform this daemon is running on.
* `ButtonGpio`: The GPIO number for the button mode. Set to -1 in order to disable it.
* `ButtonActiveLow`: Can be used to invert the button value. Default is `false`.
* `DBusBusType`: The bus type for the `dbus` interface. Can be either `system` or `session`


# Using DBUs interface

If you want to use the DBus interface in order to start and stop the bluetooth server, you can use following commands:

> Note: assuming you are running the daemon on the system DBus


## Start

```bash
dbus-send --system --dest=io.nymea.networkmanager --type=method_call --print-reply /io/nymea/networkmanager io.nymea.networkmanager.startBluetoothServer
```

## Stop

```bash
dbus-send --system --dest=io.nymea.networkmanager --type=method_call --print-reply /io/nymea/networkmanager io.nymea.networkmanager.stopBluetoothServer
```

# Development

## Bluetooth GATT profile
-------------------------------------------

In order to connect to nymea-networkmanager using bluetooth low energy, once has to perform a bluetooth discovery, filter for all low energy 
devices and connect to the device with the name `nymea`. The remote address type for connecting to `nymea-networkmanager` is `public`.


### Notifications

In order to enable/disable the notification for a characteristic with the `notify` flag, a client has to write the value `0x0100` for 
enabling and `0x0000` for disabling to the descriptor `0x2902` of the corresponding characteristic.

The *Wireless Service* allows a client to configure and monitor a wireless network connection. The connection can be controlled with the *Wireless commander* characteristic. Each command sent will generate a response on the *Comander response* characteristic containing the error code for the command. The *Wireless connection status* characteristic informs the client about the current connection status of the wireless device.

**Characteristic details**

- **C**: *Wireless commander* (W) `e081fec1-f757-4449-b9c9-bfa83133f7fc`

    - *Description*: Controll characteristic for the wireless manager. Each command sent to this characteristic will create a response report on the *Commander response* characteristic.
    - *Range*: [0-20] Byte, UTF-8, JSON
    - *Possible values*:


In following example you can find the basic structure of a command and a response. The command can be sent to this *Wireless commander* characteristic, the response will be notified on the *Commander response* characteristic. The JSON object containing the command map has to be in a compact format and must end with the '\n' character. If a data package is longer than the allowed 20 Bytes, the data must be splitted into 20 Byte packages and sent in the correct order. The end of a JSON data stream will be recognized, once the '\n' character will be found at the end of a package. The *Commander response* characteristic uses the same mechanism.
